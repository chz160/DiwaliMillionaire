## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chz160/DiwaliMillionaire.git
cd DiwaliMillionaire
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables (optional):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Google Analytics measurement ID if you want to track usage analytics:
```
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Note:** Analytics tracking is optional. If `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is not set, the application will run without analytics. Analytics will also not load if the user has "Do Not Track" enabled in their browser.

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.

### Build

Build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

**Environment Variables for Production:**

When building for production, you can set the `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX npm run build

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"; npm run build

# Windows (CMD)
set GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX && npm run build
```

For deployment platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.), set the environment variable in your platform's settings.

**For Cloudflare Pages**: See the detailed [Cloudflare Pages Setup Guide](./CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions on configuring environment variables.

### Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## How to Use

1. **Start Screen**: Click "Start Game" to begin
2. **Answer Questions**: Select one of the four answer options for each question
3. **Track Progress**: Watch the prize ladder on the right to see your current winnings
4. **Game Over**: When you finish all questions or answer incorrectly, you'll see your final prize
5. **Play Again**: Click "Play Again" to restart the game

## Customization

### Adding Questions

Edit the `questions` array in `src/app/app.ts` to add or modify quiz questions:

```typescript
questions = signal<Question[]>([
  {
    question: 'Your question here?',
    options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'],
    correctAnswer: 0 // Index of the correct answer (0-3)
  }
]);
```

### Modifying Prize Amounts

Edit the `moneyLadder` array in `src/app/app.ts` to change prize values:

```typescript
moneyLadder = signal<MoneyLevel[]>([
  { amount: 'â‚¹10,00,000', reached: false, current: false },
  // ... add more levels as needed
]);
```

### Styling

- Main theme colors are defined in `src/app/app.css` using CSS custom properties
- Global styles are in `src/styles.css`

## Technology Stack

- **Angular 20**: Modern web framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **CSS**: Custom styling with animations
- **Standalone Components**: Using Angular's latest component architecture
- **Google Analytics 4** (optional): Usage tracking and event analytics

## Analytics & Privacy

This application supports optional Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration for tracking game usage and engagement metrics. Analytics tracking:

- **Is completely optional** - the app works perfectly without it
- **Requires explicit configuration** via the `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable
- **Respects user privacy** by:
  - Honoring "Do Not Track" browser settings
  - Anonymizing IP addresses
  - Truncating game keys to prevent identification
  - Not collecting any personally identifiable information (PII)

### Tracked Events

When analytics is enabled, the following events are tracked:

- **game_start**: When a new game begins
- **game_end**: When a game concludes (with outcome: win, walk_away, or wrong_answer)
- **lifeline_used**: When a lifeline is used (fifty_fifty, ask_audience, or phone_friend)
- **question_progress**: As players progress through questions

### Setting Up Analytics

1. Create a Google Analytics 4 property at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Get your Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
3. Set the environment variable:
   - For local development: Add to `.env` file
   - For production builds: Set as environment variable during build
   - For deployment platforms: Configure in platform settings
4. Build and deploy your application

Analytics will automatically initialize if the measurement ID is present and Do Not Track is not enabled.

## Future Enhancements

- Backend integration for persistent scoring
- Multiple question sets/difficulty levels
- Lifelines (50:50, Ask the Audience, Phone a Friend)
- Sound effects and background music
- Multiplayer support
- Admin panel for managing questions
