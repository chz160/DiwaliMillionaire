# Google Analytics Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration implemented for the Diwali Millionaire game application. The implementation follows privacy-first principles and is completely optional, controlled via environment variables.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Configuration

- **Environment Variable**: `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
  - Format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX` (Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID)
  - Optional - application works perfectly without it
  - Read during build time and injected into the application

### 2. Privacy-First Design

The implementation respects user privacy through:

- **Do Not Track Support**: Automatically disables analytics if user has DNT enabled
- **IP Anonymization**: All GA requests anonymize IP addresses (`anonymize_ip: true`)
- **Data Truncation**: Game keys are truncated to first 8 characters to prevent identification
- **No PII Collection**: No personally identifiable information is collected
- **Conditional Loading**: GA script only loads if measurement ID is configured

### 3. Tracked Events

The following events are tracked when analytics is enabled:

#### game_start
- Triggered when a new game begins
- Parameters:
  - `game_key`: Truncated (first 8 chars) session identifier

#### game_end
- Triggered when a game concludes
- Parameters:
  - `outcome`: One of `win`, `walk_away`, or `wrong_answer`
  - `final_question`: Question number reached (1-based)
  - `game_key`: Truncated session identifier

#### lifeline_used
- Triggered when a player uses a lifeline
- Parameters:
  - `type`: One of `fifty_fifty`, `ask_audience`, or `phone_friend`
  - `question_number`: Current question number when lifeline was used
  - `game_key`: Truncated session identifier

#### question_progress
- Triggered when player advances to the next question
- Parameters:
  - `question_number`: New question number (1-based)
  - `game_key`: Truncated session identifier

#### page_view
- Automatically tracked by GA4 for page navigation

## File Changes

### New Files

1. **`src/app/analytics.service.ts`**
   - Core analytics service with wrapper methods for all events
   - Handles Do Not Track detection
   - Provides safety checks before sending events

2. **`src/app/analytics.service.spec.ts`**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for analytics service
   - Tests DNT behavior, event tracking, and error handling
   - All 10 tests pass successfully

3. **`src/app/analytics-init.ts`**
   - Initialization script for GA4
   - Loads gtag.js dynamically when measurement ID is present
   - Respects DNT and handles errors gracefully

4. **`.env.example`**
   - Template file for environment variables
   - Documents the GA_MEASUREMENT_ID format and usage

### Modified Files

1. **`scripts/generate-version.js`**
   - Updated to read `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` from environment
   - Injects the ID into the generated environment.ts file

2. **`src/main.ts`**
   - Calls `initializeAnalytics()` before bootstrapping the app
   - Ensures GA is ready when the application starts

3. **`src/app/app.ts`**
   - Injects `AnalyticsService`
   - Tracks events at appropriate lifecycle points:
     - `startGame()`: Tracks game_start
     - `nextQuestion()`: Tracks question_progress
     - `endGameWithReason()`: Tracks game_end
     - `useFiftyFifty()`: Tracks lifeline_used (fifty_fifty)
     - `useAskAudience()`: Tracks lifeline_used (ask_audience)
     - `usePhoneFriend()`: Tracks lifeline_used (phone_friend)

4. **`src/index.html`**
   - Added placeholder for GA initialization script
   - Includes comment explaining conditional loading

5. **`README.md`**
   - Added comprehensive documentation on analytics setup
   - Documented environment variable configuration for different platforms
   - Added new "Analytics & Privacy" section

## Usage

### Local Development

1. Create a `.env` file (optional):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your GA Measurement ID (or leave empty to disable):
   ```
   GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

### Production Build

Set the environment variable during build:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX npm run build
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"; npm run build
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
set GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX && npm run build
```

### Deployment Platforms

For cloud platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.):
1. Navigate to your project's environment variables settings
2. Add `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your measurement ID value
3. Deploy normally

## Testing

### Unit Tests

All tests pass successfully (142 total):
- 10 new tests for AnalyticsService
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No regressions introduced

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual Testing

To verify analytics integration:

1. **Without GA_MEASUREMENT_ID**: 
   - Build without setting the variable
   - Check browser console for: "Google Analytics not initialized: No measurement ID configured"
   - Verify no GA network requests are made

2. **With GA_MEASUREMENT_ID**:
   - Build with valid measurement ID
   - Check browser console for: "Google Analytics initialized with ID: G-XXXXXXXXXX"
   - Open browser DevTools Network tab
   - Start a game and verify analytics events are sent to Google Analytics

3. **With Do Not Track**:
   - Enable DNT in browser settings
   - Build with valid measurement ID
   - Verify console shows: "Google Analytics not initialized: Do Not Track is enabled"
   - Verify no GA network requests are made

## Privacy Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

The implementation includes:
- Anonymized IP addresses
- No collection of PII
- Respect for Do Not Track
- Optional nature (opt-in via configuration)

### Data Minimization

- Game keys are truncated to 8 characters
- No user-specific identifiers are tracked
- Only gameplay metrics are collected

### Transparency

- Clear documentation of tracked events
- User-visible console logs when analytics is active
- Open source code for full transparency

## Security Summary

âœ… **No security vulnerabilities detected** by CodeQL analysis

The implementation:
- Does not introduce any security risks
- Follows Angular best practices
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Never exposes sensitive data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Consent Banner**: Add user consent UI for regions requiring explicit consent
2. **Google Tag Manager**: Consider GTM for more flexible event tracking
3. **Custom Dimensions**: Add more detailed event parameters
4. **Funnel Reporting**: Set up custom funnels in GA4 for game progression analysis
5. **Event Batching**: Implement batching for high-frequency events
6. **Offline Support**: Queue events when offline and send when connection restored
