# Game Over & Summary Screen Documentation

## Overview

The Game Over & Summary Screen feature provides a comprehensive end-of-game experience for players, displaying their performance, winnings, and detailed statistics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. End Game Triggers

The game ends under the following conditions:

- **WIN**: Player answers all 15 questions correctly and wins the top prize
- **WRONG**: Player selects an incorrect answer (falls back to last checkpoint)
- **WALK_AWAY**: Player chooses to walk away with current prize
- **TIMEOUT**: Time expires (currently treated as WRONG - ready for future timer implementation)

### 2. Prize Calculation

The final prize is calculated based on the end reason:

- **WIN**: Top prize ($1,000,000)
- **WRONG/TIMEOUT**: Last checkpoint prize (checkpoints at Q5 and Q10)
- **WALK_AWAY**: Prize for last correctly answered question

### 3. Summary Screen Components

#### Headline
- Displays final winnings and congratulatory message
- Shows reason the game ended
- Indicates question progress (e.g., "Reached Q11/15")

#### Prize Display
- Prominent display of final winnings
- Themed with Diwali colors

#### Progress Ladder
- Visual representation of all answered questions
- Green checkmarks for correct answers
- Red X marks for incorrect answers

#### Statistics Section

  const result = this.gameResultService.createSessionResult(
    reason,
    this.currentQuestionIndex(),
    this.answeredQuestions(),
    this.lifelinesUsed(),
    this.questions().length
  );
  
  this.sessionResult.set(result);
  this.gameOver.set(true);
}
```

### In Template

```html
@if (gameOver() && sessionResult()) {
  <app-game-summary 
    [result]="sessionResult()!"
    (playAgain)="resetGame()">
  </app-game-summary>
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:
- **GameResultService**: 16 tests covering all prize calculations
