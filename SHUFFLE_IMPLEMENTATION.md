# Randomize Answer Option Order Per Session - Testing Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

This document summarizes the implementation and testing of the answer option shuffle feature.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Seeded Random Number Generator
- Created `seeded-random.util.ts` with deterministic shuffling
- Uses Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for reproducible results
- Includes `shuffleOptions()` function that generates shuffle based on game key + question ID
- **17 comprehensive tests** covering determinism, distribution, and edge cases

### 2. State Management
- Added `renderOrder: number[][]` to `GameState` interface
- Persists shuffle order in IndexedDB/localStorage
- Survives page refresh and session resume
- Updated all 14 existing persistence tests

### 3. Core Game Logic
- `App.startGame()`: Generates render order for all questions at session start
- `App.selectAnswer()`: Maps rendered position to original option index for correctness check
- `App.getRenderedOptions()`: Returns options in shuffled order for display
- Stores both rendered and original indices in answered questions

### 4. Lifeline Integration
- **50:50**: Removes two incorrect options based on shuffled positions
- **Ask the Audience**: Shows vote percentages for shuffled labels (A-D match visual order)
- **Phone a Friend**: References shuffled option letters
- All lifelines tested and working correctly

### 5. Game Summary / Review
- Shows options in the shuffled order they were presented
- Correctly marks chosen and correct answers
- Options array is stored in shuffled form for accurate review

## Test Coverage

### New Test Suite: `app-shuffle.spec.ts` (14 tests)
1. **Render Order Generation** (4 tests)
   - Generates order for all questions
   - Contains all indices 0-3
   - Deterministic for same game key
   - Different for different game keys

2. **Answer Selection** (2 tests)
   - Correct answer mapping
   - Incorrect answer detection

3. **Lifelines** (3 tests)
   - 50:50 removes correct options based on shuffle
   - Ask Audience shows votes for shuffled positions
   - Phone Friend hints reference shuffled positions

4. **Display** (2 tests)
   - Returns options in shuffled order
   - Preserves all options after shuffle

5. **Persistence** (1 test)
   - Saves render order in game state

6. **Answer Recording** (1 test)
   - Records with shuffled options

7. **Distribution** (1 test)
   - No bias towards any position

### Existing Tests
- All 118 existing tests continue to pass
- Updated persistence tests to handle render order parameter

## Manual Testing Completed ✅

### Test Scenarios Verified

#### ✅ Different Orders Between Sessions
- Started multiple games with different game keys
- Confirmed same question shows different option orders
- Example: Question 4 showed B, C, A, D order vs. original A, B, C, D

#### ✅ Correctness Check
- Answered questions correctly using shuffled positions
- System correctly identified correct answers regardless of position
- Wrong answers also detected correctly

#### ✅ 50:50 Lifeline
- Used lifeline on shuffled question
- Correctly removed 2 incorrect options based on visible order
- Correct answer remained visible
- Screenshot: `game-5050-lifeline.png`

#### ✅ Ask the Audience
- Showed vote percentages for all 4 options
- Chart labels (A, B, C, D) matched visible button order
- Correct answer received highest percentage (47%)
- Screenshot: `game-audience-lifeline.png`

#### ✅ Phone a Friend
- Suggested answer referenced visible button label (A, B, C, or D)
- Screenshot: `game-phone-lifeline.png`

#### ✅ Review Answers
- Game summary showed options in shuffled order
- Correctly marked chosen answer
- Correctly marked correct answer
- Screenshot: `game-review-answers.png`

## Accessibility Considerations ✅

The implementation preserves accessibility:

1. **Visual Order = DOM Order**: Buttons render in shuffled order, so tab navigation follows visual layout
2. **ARIA Labels**: Option letters (A-D) in ARIA attributes match visual display
3. **Screen Reader Friendly**: 
   - Option text is announced in visible order
   - Labels clearly indicate position (A, B, C, D as shown)
   - No confusion between internal state and presentation

4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab/Enter/Space work naturally with visual order

## Refresh-Resume Behavior ✅

**How it works:**
1. Game generates unique key on start (e.g., `G_mh1it0q7_nlrzg7`)
2. Key is added to URL as query parameter: `?game=G_mh1it0q7_nlrzg7`
3. Render order is computed using: `shuffleOptions(gameKey, questionId)`
4. Both game state and render order saved to IndexedDB/localStorage
5. On refresh, URL key is read and state is restored
6. Same game key + question ID = same shuffle order (deterministic)

**Result:** Refreshing mid-game restores exact same option order for each question.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Shuffle Algorithm
```typescript
// Seeded RNG based on game key + question ID
seed = hash(gameKey + questionId)
renderOrder[i] = shuffle([0, 1, 2, 3], seed)
```

### Correctness Mapping
```typescript
// User clicks rendered position 1
renderedIndex = 1
// Map to original position
originalIndex = renderOrder[currentQuestionIndex][renderedIndex]
// Check against original correct answer
isCorrect = originalIndex === question.correctAnswer
```

### Storage Format
```typescript
{
  renderOrder: [
    [2, 0, 3, 1],  // Question 0: C, A, D, B
    [1, 3, 0, 2],  // Question 1: B, D, A, C
    // ... for all questions
  ]
}
```

## QA Checklist - All Scenarios Passed ✅

- [x] Start two new sessions → different button orders
- [x] Refresh mid-question → same order after reload (via deterministic RNG)
- [x] Answer correctness works regardless of visual position
- [x] 50:50 hides two incorrect buttons in current order
- [x] Ask the Audience chart labels match visible options
- [x] Review Answers shows rendered order with correct option marked
- [x] Keyboard navigation follows visible order
- [x] Screen readers announce labels in visible order
- [x] No bias: correct option distributed evenly (tested with 40 iterations)
